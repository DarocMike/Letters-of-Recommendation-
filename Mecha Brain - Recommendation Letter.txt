To whom this may concern, 

My name is Ale Jim√©nez (Mecha Brain) and It is my pleasure to write this letter in support of Red. I had the pleasure of getting to know him when I started my Pixel artist career, in the project 0xWRLD and after that on WorldWideWebb.

I had the opportunity to work with Red in both projects with him as a dev team leader, his work never disappointed the project managers, he is a very organized person with a clear path to follow, I  always felt I could trust him as a leader, he was always open to talk if you had any blockers and find the best way to help you, as a leader he was very supportive and clear on his directions, our team always delivered all the tasks on time and with the high quality needed for the project. I strongly believe that Red will be a great addition to your company and will exceed your expectations in his role.

Please do not hesitate to contact me if you should require any additional information.
Sincerely, Mecha Brain, Pixel artist
