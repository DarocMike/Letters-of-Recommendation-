To Whom It May Concern,

I am writing to recommend Daniel Keeton for any programming or software development position.
I had the pleasure of working with him on the development of my upcoming mobile game, where he was responsible for some of the backend programming,
specifically the implementation of cloud saving with Google Play Services into the Game Maker engine.

Daniel Keeton proved to be an excellent programmer with a wealth of knowledge in his field.
He was able to deliver high-quality work within the given timeline and was always available to answer any questions or concerns that arose during the project.
His communication skills and positive attitude were highly valued during our collaboration and contributed to the success of the project.

Overall, I highly recommend Daniel Keeton for any programming or software development position.
His technical skills, work ethic, and professionalism make him an outstanding candidate for any project.

Thank you for considering him for your programming or software development needs.
I trust that his expertise and professional approach will make him an asset to any project.
Should you require any further information or have any questions, please do not hesitate to reach out to him directly.

Sincerely,

Michael Silva da Rocha
